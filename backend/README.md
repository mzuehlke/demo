# Getting Started

Create file `./ccitbxws-conf.py` and adjust content like so:

    # DATA_ROOT is used to resolve relative file paths passed to the web service
    DATA_ROOT = 'C:\\Users\\Norman\\EOData\\occci-v2.0\\geographic\\netcdf\\monthly\\chlor_a\\2013'

Then type to build the web service stand-alone tool `ccitbxws`:

    $ python3 setup.py develop

and start Python web service

    $ ccitbxws

In a browser, type some REST URL like so:

    http://127.0.0.1:8080/ccitbx/ne2/0/0/0.jpg
